# OIIA site

Its just a site with rotating funny images of me.

# How to open

Open `index.html` with any browser that you would like to.

# How to change images?

1. Add an image to folder `oiia-main/images`.
2. Open `index.html` file with any text or code editor, then find a
```html
<div class="spinning">
	<img src="images/image.png">
</div>
```
and change `src` paramater in `img` tag to `src="your_image.imageextension"` in the `oiia-main/images`.
3. Save `index.html` file and open it again (or reset the page with `F5` key)
